## 🧩 Task API

Task API is a production-ready REST service written in Rust with Axum and SQLx. It provides a clean CRUD interface to manage tasks backed by PostgreSQL, including priorities, statuses, and timestamps.

- 🚀 **Fast & async:** Tokio-powered concurrency for low-latency APIs.
- 🗄️ **PostgreSQL + migrations:** Schema is applied automatically on startup.
- ✅ **Task lifecycle:** Priority and status tracking with completion timestamps.
- 🔒 **Ready for integration:** CORS enabled and JSON-first responses.

Use it as a backend for web or mobile clients, or as a foundation for a larger task management platform.
